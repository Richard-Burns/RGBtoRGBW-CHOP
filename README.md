# RGBtoRGBW-CHOP

A TouchDesigner CHOP for converting RGB values to RGBW colour space

This CHOP was created using a method from Lili Wangs "Trade-off between luminance and color in RGBW displays for mobile-phone usage" paper with modifications as discussed on Stackoverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21117842/converting-an-rgbw-color-to-a-standard-rgb-hsb-representation)

Have a look in the examples folder for a toe showing usage of the RGB to RGBW CHOP. It seems to be fairly efficient.
